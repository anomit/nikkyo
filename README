A generic guard process (to be implemented as a daemon) that client processes
can interact with to gain locked access to keys primarily for updating values in
key value storage systems like memcached.

Protocol is straightforward at the moment. All messages are CRLF terminated.

Client connects and sends 'LOCK <key>\r\n'
Daemon replies back with 'LOCKED <key>\r\n'

Client performs necessary operations and then sends 'UNLOCK\r\n'
                     OR
Client may quit as well without unlocking using 'QUIT\r\n'
In both cases daemon replies back with 'QUIT\r\n' and closes the socket
